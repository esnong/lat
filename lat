Cost and Efficiency Challenges of Outsourcing with Accenture:

Over time, the costs associated with outsourcing to Accenture began to creep up, putting significant strain on the company’s operational budget. The increasing costs were compounded by inefficiencies in the outsourcing model, where the performance and quality of the outputs fell short of expectations. Additionally, Accenture's limited understanding of Pratt & Whitney (P&W) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) policies led to a disconnect between the outsourced operations and the internal standards and practices critical to the business. This misalignment created barriers to optimizing processes and delivering the desired outcomes, hindering the company’s ability to stay competitive and meet key performance goals.

OneRTX Story: Unifying P&W Asia, PWC, and PWMS through Harmonization

In response to these challenges, the company embarked on a strategic initiative called OneRTX, aimed at integrating and harmonizing its various business units across the APAC region. The OneRTX strategy sought to bring together P&W Asia, PWC, and PWMS under a unified framework to streamline operations and improve coordination between the different arms of the organization. This harmonization of processes across the APAC region and the broader business units not only aimed at improving consistency but also at ensuring that all units were aligned with the core values and operational standards of P&W and RTX.

By connecting these previously siloed operations, the company sought to enhance collaboration and efficiency, reduce redundancy, and create a more cohesive and responsive structure across the business. The focus on harmonizing business practices also involved rethinking the roles of different teams, encouraging them to adopt a more holistic approach toward problem-solving and decision-making.

Benchmarking for Consistency: Collaborating with Collins and US Teams

As part of the OneRTX initiative, the company conducted a thorough benchmarking exercise to analyze processes and performance standards across different regions and units. This included benchmarking against key industry players such as Collins Aerospace and the company’s US-based teams. The benchmarking aimed to identify best practices, pinpoint inefficiencies, and set a clear path toward achieving an aspirational state of consistency in all operations. By measuring against leading industry standards and peers, the company sought to establish a baseline of excellence, which would guide the transformation efforts toward greater operational efficiency and effectiveness.

The benchmarking process also involved identifying gaps in knowledge and performance, particularly with regard to regional differences in processes and practices. This would help ensure that the future state of operations was not only efficient but also consistent across regions, laying the foundation for a standardized approach to business functions across the organization.

System Blueprinting: Laying the Foundation for Future Success

To achieve the goals set out by OneRTX, the company undertook a detailed process of system blueprinting. This involved mapping out the desired future state of operations, defining the technical requirements, and establishing the architecture needed to support the harmonization and integration of business units. The blueprint served as a strategic guide, ensuring that the systems being developed were tailored to the specific needs of the company while adhering to the policies and standards set by P&W and RTX.

The blueprinting process also focused on creating a scalable and flexible system that could evolve over time, adapting to new challenges, market demands, and technological advancements. By carefully planning the technical infrastructure and aligning it with the company’s strategic vision, the blueprint provided a clear roadmap for the successful implementation of the OneRTX initiative.
