The team identified rising outsourcing costs, inefficiencies in the current model, and a lack of understanding of P&W and RTX policies. To address this, they launched the OneRTX initiative, integrating P&W Asia, PWC, and PWMS to harmonize operations across APAC and business units. The team benchmarked processes, including those from Collins Aerospace and the U.S., to achieve operational consistency. Additionally, system blueprinting was developed to standardize and optimize processes across the organization.
