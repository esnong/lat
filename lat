Award Categories:

The specific award criteria are outlined in an image (not provided here), but the general understanding is that the teams are categorized based on their performance across several key criteria. Each team can win a specific segment if they excel in that area. There is also a "Leadership Award" that covers general excellence.
Personal Observations:

The award criteria appear to align with the way teams are categorized and selected. Teams are likely evaluated based on how they perform in each category, and those excelling in a specific segment are likely to win in that segment.
Consider suggesting that submitting teams highlight which category they believe they excel in the most. This focus could give them a clear target to aim for.
Team names are usually simple, often resembling research titles (typically between 4 to 10 words).
Suggestions:

For 2025, it’s a good idea to review RTX improvement targets and ensure that the nominated projects align with one of these targets. This could increase the project’s relevance and impact, boosting its chances of success.
